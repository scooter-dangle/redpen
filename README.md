Reserved name for a teensy side-project I'm working on.

Crate living will
-----------------

It's (_checks clock_) just now March 20, 2022 Easter Time. If I haven't
done anything with this by March 20, 2024, I'm probly never going to
(esp since that gives me a Leap Day as _well_ to get cracking). In that
case, feel free to ping me if you have a decent use for the name.

If crates.io peeps are able and willing to exercise such authority,
they should feel free to re√§ssign this name to someone else if that
person/group can show they contacted me after March 20, 2024 via means
that will show up in my email (e.g., Twitter) and got no response within
4 months (_and_, again, if I've done nothing further than reserve this
name).

To make it obvious that there is no connection with any previous API,
any new person/project repurposing this crate name MUST start their
major version at a number at least 10 major versions higher than the
last major version under my ownership.

E.g., if the last version published under the crate's current form were
`3.8.1`, the first version of the crate published by a new owner must be
greater or equal to `13.0.0`.
